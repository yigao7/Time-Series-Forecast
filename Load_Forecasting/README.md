To operate effectively, reliably, and meet the demands of their customers, power companies must accurately predict demand for electricity. Demand (or load) is defined as the rate in megawatts at which electric energy is delivered to customers.

On a daily basis power companies actively trade(buy/sell) energy in either regulated or deregulated energy markets. Having the right load forecast is imperative because SCE wants to ensure its customers are getting the lowest prices for electricity. By buying too much unused energy, SCE must endure loss of revenue and face potential penalties by state regulators. However, by not buying enough, they risk having to buy energy in "real time" at a higher price. 

This projects uses historical load data of 1/1/2008 – 12/31/2011 to fit/predict hourly load for the period of 1/1/2008 – 12/31/2012.
