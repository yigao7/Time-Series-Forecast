The air transport industry relies heavily on forecasting air passenger demand for supporting management decisions on a variety of application areas: operation of new routes, closing routes, ticket price policies, management of mileage programs, acquisition of aircrafts, staff training programs, participation on alliances of strategic cooperation between airline companies, sufficiency of current infrastructure, the opportunity of building new terminals, etc.

With that motivation, I built a predictive model to forecast future passenger demand for next 12 months.
